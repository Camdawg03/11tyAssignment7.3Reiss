# About **Finn**
<img class="about" alt="Finn" src="/images/Finn7.3.png" width="500" />


## Drifting through the uncharted void, Finn is the sole human ambassador to the infinite. Alone by choice—or perhaps by fate—he travels between stars, navigating ancient nebulae and forgotten worlds with only the hum of his ship and the silence of deep space for company.

## Once a promising scientist on Earth, Finn left his homeworld decades ago, driven by equal parts wanderlust and a yearning to find meaning in the unknown. Equipped with a battered but reliable starship, a library of Earth’s lost history, and a journal filled with his own musings, Finn explores the galaxy not as a conqueror, but as a witness.

## He seeks no glory, nor does he expect to return. His name is known only to the stars he has named, and the ruins he has walked alone. From storm-wracked gas giants to frozen moons hiding alien seas, Finn’s journey is both an act of defiance against solitude and an embrace of it.

## Somewhere, light-years from the nearest human voice, Finn charts his own mythology—one quiet step at a time.
