### There’s a moment — just after the final scan completes, after the last coordinates log themselves into my ship’s archives — when it hits me. The silence. The weight of it.

### This place, this stretch of stars and dust, has never been seen by human eyes. It existed long before me, before Earth ever cooled, before anyone thought to name the stars. And now, for however long humanity endures — or doesn’t — my name is the first thread tied to it.

### The system itself is… unremarkable, if you only look at the numbers. A dying yellow dwarf, circling a pair of lifeless, scarred rocks. No breathable atmospheres, no flickers of life, no ancient ruins hinting at forgotten civilizations. Just gravity and silence. But out here, even silence has weight.

### There’s beauty in that, I think. The idea that even the barren corners of the galaxy deserve to be witnessed. I took the ship in close to the second planet — a rust-red sphere cracked down its equator like an old piece of pottery. Scans show evidence of liquid water beneath the southern pole, but nothing alive. Not yet. Maybe not ever.

### Still, I logged it all. The mineral composition. The faint magnetic fields flickering and fading with the solar wind. The way the sun sets slow here, dragging dusk out for hours longer than it should.

### I don’t know who, if anyone, will ever read these notes. But I write them anyway. It’s how I remind myself I’m real — that I’m not just another ghost drifting between stars.

### I named the system Keshra — after someone I used to know. Someone who believed every place, no matter how empty, deserved a name. 

### Tomorrow, I’ll plot a course for the next unmarked patch of sky. For now, I’ll sit here a little longer, watching the light fade over a nameless horizon.
